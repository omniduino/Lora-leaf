# Omniduino Lora-leaf
Omniduino Lora-leaf is part of the Omniduino family, a bidirectional wireless communication solution focused on the Internet of Things (IoT) that integrates several functions for communication/control links where a long range and minimum energy consumption is required.

• includes an RFM9x module(LoRa), a bidirectional wireless communication module for Long range and Low Power communications manufactured by HopeRF
You can find the data sheet at the link: https://www.hoperf.com/data/upload/portal/20190801/RFM95W-V2.0.pdf

• includes a Voltage level coupler (level shifter), so the RFM9x module that works at 3.3Volts can talk to a 5Volts or 3.3Volts master Module (Arduino, Raspberry-PI, Blue Pill, Etc.)

• In order to simplify the applications, it includes an Integrated helical antenna into the PCB
